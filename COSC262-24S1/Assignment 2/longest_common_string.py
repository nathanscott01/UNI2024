COSC262 Assignment 2
Longest Common String

Notes:
    LCS function written in Lab 9 Question 6 used recursion and was a top down solution.
    For this exercise, a bottom up approach needs to be implemented without recursion.
    Steps needed to solve this:

    1. Create a table
    2. Backtrack on the table to obtain the longest common string
